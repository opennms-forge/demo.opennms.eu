== Installation

In the current state this applications stack is tested with CentOS only.
It is installed on *demo01.internal.opennms.com* in */etc/docker/compose/*.
Check out the source code and clone the configuration modules.

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/opennms-forge/demo.opennms.org.git
cd demo.opennms.org
git submodule update --init
----

=== Initiate the application stack

The process contains a full redeploy, so the current system (if it is running) will deleted completely.
**All rrd archives and Postgresql database will be lost!**

[source, bash]
----
cd setup
./init.sh
----

== Usage 

The provided scripts in `setup` folder are described https://github.com/opennms-forge/demo.opennms.org/blob/master/setup/README.adoc[here].

=== Restart application stack

To restart the whole stack use:
[source, bash]
----
systemctl restart docker-compose@demo.opennms.org
----
=== Enhancements & Ideas

Ideas for new implementations of other OpenNMS features can be documented in the issue section.

=== Configuration updates

Configuration updates or changes should be provided as a pull request.
Once the pull request is merged and pulled to the local repository on the demo system, the changes can be loaded with:

[source, bash]
----
#/etc/docker/compose/demo.opennms.org/: docker-compose up -d
----

in the root folder.

=== OpenNMS Update

Docker-compose file already use `latest` repo, so a re-deploy explained above or `docker-compose pull` will do an upgrade.
